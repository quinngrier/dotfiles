# This file (~/.bashrc-bottom) holds the code that should be put at the
# bottom of the ~/.bashrc file. The following command can be put at the
# bottom of the ~/.bashrc file to do this indirectly:
#
#       . ~/.bashrc-bottom
#
# The reason for not putting the code directly into the ~/.bashrc file
# is to make it easier to work with default ~/.bashrc files on systems
# that provide them. It is easier to make this file portable and make
# the above small change on each system than it is to make a portable
# ~/.bashrc file that reasonably subsumes all default ~/.bashrc files.
#
# Note that the master copy of the default ~/.bashrc file can sometimes
# be found at one of the following locations:
#
#       /etc/skel/.bashrc
#

#
# PS1 defines the prompt string, which looks like this:
#
#       [0][user@host:/current/working/directory]
#       $
#
# The "[0]" part is the exit status of the last command. If the command
# was a pipeline, then the exit status of every command in the pipeline
# will appear, separated by spaces. For example, "true | false | false"
# yields "[0 1 1]". The first line of the prompt string is colored all
# the way to the edge of the window for visual distinction. The window
# title is kept updated to "user@host:/current/working/directory".
#

PS1='\[\e[0m\]\[\e]0;\u@\h:\w\a\]\[\e[37;44m\]\[\e[K\]'
PS1="${PS1}"'[${PIPESTATUS[@]}][\u@\h:\w]\[\e[0m\]\n\$ '

# The ssha alias sets up ssh-agent and starts an inner shell for you to
# work in. When you exit the inner shell, the alias shuts down ssh-agent
# and exits the outer shell. You can use this to "replace" your current
# shell with one that has ssh-agent set up.
