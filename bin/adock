#
# Usage: adock [<argument>...]
#
# adock runs an asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor container with the given
# arguments. The current working directory will be mapped into and used
# as the current working directory in the container. The container will
# inherit the current user and group IDs so that any files it produces
# will have the appropriate ownership.
#
# See <https://hub.docker.com/r/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor/> for
# more information about the asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor image.
#
# You can change the docker command by setting the DOCKER environment
# variable. The content of the variable will be evaluated by the shell.
#
# You can change the container image by setting the ADOCK_IMAGE
# environment variable.
#
# Example 1:
#
# The following command will compile README.adoc into README.html:
#
#       adock asciidoctor README.adoc
#
# Example 2:
#
# The following command will compile README.adoc into README.pdf:
#
#       adock asciidoctor-pdf README.adoc
#
# Example 3:
#
# The following command will compile README.adoc into README.html,
# running docker with sudo:
#
#       DOCKER="sudo docker" adock asciidoctor README.adoc
