Usage: git ub [<branch=work> [<remote=upstream> [<start=main>]]]

Switches to branch <start>, then fetches and merges it from <remote>,
then starts <branch> from it. <branch> will be recreated if it already
exists as an ancestor of <start>.

If <remote> is "upstream" but this remote is not defined, <remote> will
be adjusted to "origin". This allows both origin+upstream workflows and
origin-only workflows to be used without specifying <remote>.

If <start> is "main" but this branch does not exist and branch "master"
exists, <start> will be adjusted to "master".
