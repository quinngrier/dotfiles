Usage: gpgqg-gpgsec <name> <user_id> [<arg>...]

Generate a GPG keypair with the gpgqg utility and store it with the
gpgsec utility as two secrets <name> and <name>.pub. The gpgqg utility
will be invoked as "gpgqg <file> <user_id> [<arg>...]", where <file> is
a temporary file that will be deleted at program exit.

The gpgqg and gpgsec utilities are available at
<https://gitlab.com/quinngrier/dotfiles/-/blob/master/bin/gpgqg> and
<https://gitlab.com/quinngrier/dotfiles/-/blob/master/bin/gpgsec>.
