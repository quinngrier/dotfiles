Usage: gpgsec <name> [<value>]

Stores and retrieves GPG-encrypted secrets to and from the ~/.gpgsec
directory.

If <value> is not given, the ~/.gpgsec/<name> file is decrypted and
written to standard output. Otherwise, if <value> is the empty string,
the ~/.gpgsec/<name> file is deleted with rm -f. Otherwise, <value> is
encrypted and stored to ~/.gpgsec/<name>.

GnuPG 2 must already be installed and a default-key must already be set
up in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf. The --default-recipient-self option is used to
encrypt the secrets. The fgpg2 script must also already be installed
(see <https://gitlab.com/quinngrier/dotfiles/-/blob/master/bin/fgpg2>).
