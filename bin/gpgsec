Usage: gpgsec <name> [<value>]

Manages GPG-encrypted secrets in the ~/.gpgsec directory.

If <value> is omitted, the ~/.gpgsec/<name>.gpg file will be decrypted
and written to standard output. Otherwise, if <value> is empty, the file
will be deleted. Otherwise, <value> will be encrypted and stored to the
file. If <value> is "-", it will be read from standard input.

<name> may freely contain directory components, allowing secrets to be
organized into directories.

gpg2 must already be installed and a default-key must already be set up
in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf. The --default-recipient-self option will be used
to perform the encryption.
