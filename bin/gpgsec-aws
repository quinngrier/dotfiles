# TODO: This is a quick and dirty first version of this script. It
#       should have standard options parsing long term.

#
# Amazon says the following:
#
#       Ensure that your custom credential tool does not write any
#       secret information to StdErr because the SDKs and AWS CLI
#       can capture and log such information, potentially exposing
#       it to unauthorized users.

# For sanity, we'll just never output anything to stderr.
