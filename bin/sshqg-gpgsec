Usage: sshqg-gpgsec <name> <comment> [<arg>...]

Generate an SSH keypair with the sshqg utility and store it with the
gpgsec utility as two secrets <name> and <name>.pub. The sshqg utility
will be invoked as "sshqg <file> <comment> [<arg>...]", where <file> is
a temporary file that will be deleted at program exit.

The sshqg and gpgsec utilities are available at
<https://gitlab.com/quinngrier/dotfiles/-/blob/master/bin/sshqg> and
<https://gitlab.com/quinngrier/dotfiles/-/blob/master/bin/gpgsec>.
