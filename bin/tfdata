# This script allows any command to be used with Terraform's external
# data source. For example:
#
#       data "external" "foo" {
#         program = ["tfdata", "echo", "hello", "world"]
#       }
#
#       # data.external.foo.result.stdout will be "hello world".
#
# This script does not parse any options. It simply runs the arguments
# as a command. /dev/null is always used for the standard input of the
# command. If no arguments are given, no command is run and the output
# will be empty.
